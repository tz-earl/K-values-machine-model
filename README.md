# K-values-machine-model

Inspired by Peter Lehrer’s work on fluid dynamics.

One part of Peter’s work was to write MatLab software to implement a mathematical model that calculates a maximal value of a variable K given inputs of four variables. For our purposes it is not necessary to understand the physics and the math of what the inputs and the outputs mean, although it should be noted that the mathematical model is fairly complex in that it applies polynomials in various terms of higher powers.

We can treat the MatLab code as a black box or function that accepts certain inputs and generates corresponding outputs. This project is an attempt to create a machine learning model that acts as an equivalent black box.
